# BigMart-Sales-Prediction

## Introduction
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. 
The objective is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. 
By the help of this model, BigMart will try to understand the features of products and stores which have a significant impact in increasing the sales. 

Please note that the data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly.
